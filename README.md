Python text to speech from medium articles
Aim of this was basically to be able to convert txt, pdf and urls into mp3 files to play in car or listen to when out 
and about.  Doppler is probably going to be the app of choice to actually play these on as supports carplay apps
however still a fair few issues potentially with logins etc for this to work well
not really sure how much I will use - as kindle text to speech is OK for many things but not always ideal to control
when driving/cylcing
